Electronics time! Today I got the bench power supply hooked up to the fully
running chassis that lives under the '05 Mustang.

The first run is at 2 volts. Nothing crazy, but good to see the car running again.

Here's a short video running at 2 volts.

The power setup is pretty naive, but it works.

Running at 9 volts things get spicy. The car originally only had up to 6V from
its batteries, but here we run it up higher. The motor should be ok, although it
likely will have a reduced lifetime.
