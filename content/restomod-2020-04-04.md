Summary: Before and after pictures, the design is almost a good fit. There are some spacing issues at the wheel well but visually the layout and the headlights are close to the original style.

Before and after pictures, the design is almost a good fit. There are some
spacing issues at the wheel well but visually the layout and the headlights are
close to the original style.

Inspecting the fit from the side of the car

Things are starting to shape up. I'd almost forgetten that the end goal was to
put this back on the chassis.

Unfortunately, the wheels collide with the inside supports of the front bumper.
There should be plenty of space to remove a section so the wheel can turn and
the suspension can compress freely.

Another consideration: with the suspension fully compressed, the new front
design would rub along the ground. That's fine if the car's running on graph
paper, less so if it's going to be running on uneven surfaces.
