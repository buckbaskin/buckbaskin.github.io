Summary: Cleaning and repairing an old Simplex Derailleur round 1: Disassembly and degreasing

I had the unfortunate luck of being the owner who gets to figure out what to do
when the pedal crank on my old Peugeot road bike snapped in half while riding.
After some luck in (hopefully) finding the right part, I've set about getting
the rest of the bike back in more suitable condition. 

The first step is
figuring out what was the issue with the rear derailleur. For a short while
before the pedal had its moment, the derailleur really only worked when
pedalling forward and would jam the chain mechanism when trying to pedal
backwards. This made me suspect the spring, but to find out I needed to do a
little disassembly.

As part of the process, I found an ingenious little hack for not losing pulley
parts: The inner diameter of the pulley mechanism exactly matches the outer
diameter of a Presta valve from an inner tube that I'd popped (but kept around
just in case it was useful, isn't that handy).

Here's a better picture of the mechanism now that it's a little more exposed
(although all it seems to be exposing is dirt and some rust)

# Found the Problem

Videos coming soon!

After a little wrenching, it was easy to see why things weren't working. The
spring that keeps the mechanism aligned with the frame had snapped at one of the
legs.

# Cleaning

The first round of cleaning the derailleur involved a heavy use of degreaser and
a scrub brush (and making a mess). It's a little hard to see in the photos, but
there was gobs of grease and junk coming off the derailleur as I was
disassembling, but there was still plenty more ready to scrub off. The end
result looks fairly nice and cleaned up; however, it revealed some rust that I'm
going to clear out in round 2.

# Onwards!

In the next few days I'm going to take a pass at cleaning up the rust and
finding the right spring to replace the broken one now that I can match it to
parts easily. In addition, I'm thinking I may replace some of the rusty screws
with new ones while I have the mechanism apart. One thing I'm not sure on is the
bushings for the pulleys. It seems like they're in acceptable condition, but if I can
find some drop-in replacements I may swap them out as well.
