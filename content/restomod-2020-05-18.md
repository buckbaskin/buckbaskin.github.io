Two more iterations on the battery cover / side skirts

This last iteration cuts away more of the side skirts to try and get to ground
clearance that's closer to that of the original part and the front and rear
bumpers. It is still a very low part that will likely scrape a lot; however,
I think it's an improvement to have all of the parts at the same level visually.
