Summary: Sharing a satisfying effort to fix a hat and a glove with a little sewing

I wanted to share a satisfying effort to fix a hat and a glove that I've had for
a little while that were both worse for wear. The hat's string had been ripped
off after an "encounter" with a bicycle. The glove was slowly coming apart at
the seams (and had needed fixing for far too long...)
