The suspension work continues! The rear design with short arms plastically
deformed after the first flex, so I ended up changing to a more complicated
design with longer arms. The new design should also allow for equal length and
thickness arms on the front and rear designs.

# Front Design

# Rear Design

Based on the front design, but with different packaging for the rear dimensions
of the chassis.

The rear suspension design has to deal with quite a lot of travel given the
length of the arms as designed.

Each bushing is ~2mm, so it's between 3 and 4 mm of suspension travel

This leads to a huge amount of flex in the rear suspension, which led to plastic
deformation when I compressed it fully.

Even when unloaded the suspension is still deformed after one compression cycle

You can see the results of the deformation near the mounting screw

Here you can see the stress deformations. Of note, the fractures tend to travel
along the printed fill lines and seem to originate from where the screw mounts
the suspension.

# Checking to see how it looks

The new suspension has a high effective spring rate, so the body rides
relatively high.

# New Rear Design

The new design lengthens the arms to reduce how much the plastic needs to flex
for a given length. This "dog-bone" packaging does make the arms much weaker;
however, this approaches a similar spring rate as the original XMods suspension
design.

When printed the gap is almost not there. It's just enough to be able to gently
snap apart after taking the part off the print bed.

With no load the suspension sits slightly flexed

# Stress-Testing the New Rear Design

Under compression. Note significantly reduced curvature compared with the
original rear design.

Here's a closer look at the new design after it'd been forced through its range
of motion a couple of times. The fractures seem to spread from the end of the
split between the mount and the arms. There's a similar pattern here of the
stress travelling parallel to the fill direction.

# Slicing Up the New Design

Looking at the slicing for the new design, it's easier to see the fill direction
with the default settings.

![Slicer view of stressed layer]({attach}/img/Alpha3_FlexRearSus_Slice_Partial.jpg)

The stresses seem to concentrate along the red fill

![Top down slicer view]({attach}/img/Alpha3_FlexRearSus_Slice_Over.jpg)

I was originally concerned that printing the version number into the part would
cause it to break more easily; however, the tension stresses are primarily on
the other side of the part. It appears that the design resists compressive
forces well enough that there isn't visible deformation on the top.

To adjust the design and see if I can get better stress patterns (and less
permanent deformation) I decided to try increasing the shells to align the fill
along the direction where it would be most stressed. In the XMods design, the
lower A-arms can handle a lot of the longitudinal and lateral loading from the 
road, so the upper A-arm should mostly be stressed vertically (in an ideal world
for this design). Even in a non-ideal world, the forces should primarily act to
bend the suspension instead of shearing it, so the aligned print shouldn't have
too much downside.
