Photos from Day 14: A replacement half-shaft and a broken front upright

A replacement part for the half-shaft I broke testing new axle designs

When I finally got back to assembling the suspension after fixing the
half-shaft, I cracked the upright on the '05 Mustang chassis.

My next project: Replace the front upright with a printed design

The goal is to match the range of motion and functionality of the existing
part. I'm hoping I can simplify the geometry a little bit to make the print work
consistently.
