Iterating on designs for a more "aero" replacement battery cover and the rear
bumper

# A new rear bumper design

The new design allows for a little more airflow between the top surface (air
coming from the motor) and the bottom surface (air coming from under the car).
Ideally, the extra flow will help keep the flow from the motor attached and
pulling hot air from inside the car.

# Battery Cover

Unfortunately, the side clips weren't a good fit

## Ducting

Also, the first iteration for the side ducting didn't print well because the
design came to a fine point

The ducting also didn't sit flush to the body because I was too conservative
when measuring the space between the edge of the cover and the body

## A Small 4mm Clearance Issue

There was also an internal clearance issue that prevented the case from clipping
on properly

It's a little hard to see in this image, but the thinner underside of the part
is warped because of the fit issue when I forced it to clip on

The problem comes down to the small tabs at the front and back of the battery
compartment.

On the original battery cover, the extrusion between the batteries stopped
short of the end of the case, but the ones in my original design were too long.

## Taking a Step Back

The overall design did look good when paired with the front and rear bumpers in
the same color

It ended up being a quick fit to get a battery cover that works, although it
took a couple iterations to get the side skirt design to where it visually fit
the rest of the car.
