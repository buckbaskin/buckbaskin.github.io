Blogs, Books and Podcasts (technically listening, I know)

# Reading

## Blogs and Privacy

### [If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs](http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs)

[About TTThis](http://tttthis.com/about/)

Another article by the same blog [The transit system here is better than in my country](http://tttthis.com/edit/blog/the-transit-system-here-is-better-than-in-my-country)

Can I add support for web mentions and other distributed web items? What
about metadata/[microdata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Microdata)

Unfortunately, I don't remember the article where I first found out about microdata

### [Blogging is not dead](https://www.garron.blog/en/blog/blogging.html)

Internet bubbles are real... I want to do things to surface that blogs aren't dead

Another article [Testing PicoCMS](https://www.garron.blog/en/blog/testing-picocms.html)

Overall, the blog is both an interesting perspective and a blog I'd like to keep up with


### [New York Times phasing out all 3rd-party advertising data](https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-advertising-792b3cd6-4bdb-47c3-9817-36601211a79d.html)

Woo! I think? 

As an institution I certainly trust the New York Times more 
than vague 3rd party ad companies, and I'm tempted to ask them to fill 
out my demographics correctly. On the flip side, I still don't think I
want ads targeted to me. I'm not sure targeted ads would be any more
useful to me. Maybe it's a trade off, where I'd trade a little of my 
personal info as a reward for the company taking a nice step, although I 
don't get to trade back my info at any point so I'm not sure it's a trade
and more of a giveaway.

## Reverse Engineering a Microcontroller

### [Extracting ROM constants from the 8087 math coprocessor's die](http://www.righto.com/2020/05/extracting-rom-constants-from-8087-math.html)

Microprocessors, reverse engineering, cool microscope pics

Another article on [decapping a power chip](http://www.righto.com/2020/05/tiny-transformer-inside-decapping.html)

## Investing

### The Intelligent Investor

- Chapter 8 - Mr Market
- Chapter 9 - Mutual Funds

Probably the vegetables of my reading recently

## Power Tools

### [Power Tool Manufacturers Who Owns Them](https://www.protoolreviews.com/news/power-tool-manufacturers-who-owns-them/43632/)

I've heard AvE discuss this, but damn this is a short list for a long list of brands

## Storytelling

### [Obscuritory - When SimCity Got Serious](https://obscuritory.com/sim/when-simcity-got-serious/)

Fascinating. I still enjoy SimCity and I liked learning about its history.


# Listening

## 99 PI

- [Unsheltered In Place](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unsheltered-in-place/)
- [Masking for a Friend](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/masking-for-a-friend/)
- [The Smell of Concrete After Rain](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-smell-of-concrete-after-rain/)
- [The Natural Experiment](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-natural-experiment/)
    - I found this one interesting because I thought that the experiments were
      quite interesting. Also, I had this urge to find the positive experiences
      during a challenging time.
    - Nature is recovering
- [Articles of Interest 7](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/a-fantasy-of-fashion-articles-of-interest-7/)
- [Articles of Interest 8](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/knockoffs-articles-of-interest-8/)
    - My gut reaction was to double down on my dislike of the fashion
      industry...

## Ear Hustle

- [Hold That Space](https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2020/4/29/hold-that-space)
    - This got me thinking about relationships and family. It's probably not the
      best guide, but the stories about family and relationships and making the
      best with what you have on the show have reminded me to do the best that I
      can.
- [Sorry Means Nothing](https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2020/4/15/sorry-means-nothing)
    - I had a lot of trouble with this one and I still haven't finished it

## Over the Road

Overall, I find the series interesting. I spent some time working for a trucking
company so I got to know a little bit about it, but there's still so much more
to learn about a group of people who I've seen but not had a chance to talk to.

- [The Biggest Tailgate in Trucking](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/the-biggest-tailgate-in-trucking)
- [Why We Drive](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/why-we-drive)
- [Brief Update From the Road](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/brief-update-from-the-road)
    - I was interested to hear from a trucker directly about how COVID was
      affecting him and his family.
- [A Brief History of Trucking in America](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/a-brief-history-of-trucking-in-america)
    - This was interesting, I'd definitely like to hear a more detailed history,
      especially if they're able to continue to tell it from people who are
      connected to the story.
- [Three Stops in Kentucky](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/three-stops-in-kentucky)
    - I want to stop here (pick any of the three or probably all three places)
- [Update From the Road April 14](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/update-from-the-road-april-14)
    - Kindness yay!
- [Back Home](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/back-home)
- [Our Punjabi Brothers](https://www.overtheroad.fm/episodes/our-punjabi-brothers)
    - I enjoyed hearing this story. It also gave me a chance to reflect on how
      we can help each other
    - It also reminded me of this [New York Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/dining/punjabi-dhaba-truckers.html) about Balvinder Singh Saini and Mansi Tiwari serving      food for truckers
