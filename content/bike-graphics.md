While I had the bike in the shop (for too long!) I decided to acquire some
vinyl sticker material to see what I could do about recreating the sticker
graphics that have been falling off the bike.

The first step I took was tracing out the graphics in their current state:

![White paper with black pen wrapped around a blue metallic tube]({attach}/img/IMG_3003.jpg)

Unwrapped, this provides a pretty good target to aim for and take measurements

Then I went through the vinyl that I have to try and match the colors of the
graphics and paint:

Blue for the frame color

Oranges for the darker sticker graphics

Yellow, orange and red for the lighter sticker graphics

I also have black vinyl for the background.

This all feeds back to 3D Printing, surprise surprise. Now that I have
measurements for the templates that I want to trace, I can 3D print stencils
and cut the patterns with a knife.

Once I have the cut patterns, I can use transfer paper to lay out the pieces
correctly, then apply them to the bike.
