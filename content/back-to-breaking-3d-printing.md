Summary: The second printed pedal finally broke. The two pieces still press fit together nicely, so it wasn't a catastrophic failure by any measure. I took some photos of the part after it happened with the intent to try and understand how it broke and how to make it stronger.

The second printed pedal finally broke (I didn't actually notice when it
happened). The two pieces still press fit together nicely, so it wasn't a
catastrophic failure by any measure.

I took some photos of the part after it happened with the intent to try and
understand how it broke and how to make it stronger.

I've been doing some digging to see when I printed the pedals and found some
pictures I took of when I broke the other pedal. I did a
[little writeup](/blog/the-aftermath-of-breaking-a-pedal.html) based on the
photos and what I remember; however, I still haven't found photos from the
original print. Even if I can't find the original print date, the post from
January 2021 would date the print to late 2020, which means that the pedal has
held up for at least two and a half years.
