Summary: The second printed pedal finally broke. The two pieces still press fit together nicely, so it wasn't a catastrophic failure by any measure. I took some photos of the part after it happened with the intent to try and understand how it broke and how to make it stronger.

The second printed pedal finally broke (I didn't actually notice when it
happened). The two pieces still press fit together nicely, so it wasn't a
catastrophic failure by any measure.

I took some photos of the part after it happened with the intent to try and
understand how it broke and how to make it stronger.
