With the first prototype, I focused on getting something that would fit the 3
mounting points on the standard body.

One thing to note on the early prototype was that a handful of the dimensions
were off, especially for the mounting points; however, they were close enough
that it was still possible to flex the plastic piece into place. The worst
problem caused by flexing was the fact that the part actually pitched up a
little bit, which made it harder to estimate the proper dimensional corrections
to make.

The original bumper and a set of calipers for scale (no bananas were within
reach).
