Summary: I have a sweatshirt that ripped a pocket. It's quite comfy, but I don't wear it much because I always worry about losing something in the pockets. Today I decided to sew up the pocket. I also considered patching it but the whole was small enough that it didn't need a patch.

I have a sweatshirt that ripped a pocket. It's quite comfy, but I don't wear it
much because I always worry about losing something in the pockets. Today I
decided to sew up the pocket. I also considered patching it but the whole was
small enough that it didn't need a patch.

The whole was about 1 and a half inches long. Fortunately, there was some
fabric material available on both sides of the tear and not just the zipper.

To fix it up, I decided to sew it like I was lacing up shoes

Pulling it tight
