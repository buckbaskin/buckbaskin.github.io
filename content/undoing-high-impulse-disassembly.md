Fixing a seat support that cracked (shattered?) in a crash

First, the shattered design, in place:

Taken off the bike it's easier to see the break, which is surprisingly uneven
for the top layers. I would have expected a more clean break here.

Taking a closer look at the bottom piece, the metal rods essentially just
punched through the bottom bracket in the rear of the design.

Taking a look at the underside, we can see that the rods essentially ripped out
the infill and bottom layers, leaving the shell walls. 
My initial intuition is that this suggests that we can
make the overall design stronger with more shells, but I'm curious to think
through if that would transfer stress to other portions, or perhaps the
limitation in strength is the bonding between the bottom layers and the walls.

Here's a better look at how the top shattered. Overall, it's harder to see a
consistent trend in how it broke, but looking near the inner ring and outer
surfaces, it does seem to be more continuous and less varied for the outer
shells.

# Fixed!

It took resurrecting some older design files, with some updates (that so far
seem to be improvements). The bottom has a bit of a wider ring for easier
printing and there are more shells internally. Time will tell how this design
holds up, although it's largely waiting for another crash before we'll really
get a test.
