Summary: With the first prototype, I focused on getting something that would fit the 3 mounting points on the standard body.

The print that I did today focused on getting the sizing right for the opening
that the part needed to fit. I had measured with calipers ahead of time, but I
wanted to be sure that the part would fit as printed.

Also, for a little bit of an Easter egg, I've been experimenting with how to
indicate the date and track versions of each printed part. In this version, I
printed the date and the revision number. I also added dots indicating the month
and day of the month, although they don't stand out in this picture.

At this point, I feel pretty confident that I got the fit right for the
mounting points, so I'm going to move onto getting the styling and the fit with
the rest of the body dialed in.
