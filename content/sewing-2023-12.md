I have a small backpack that I love and have used for many years.
Unfortunately, the backpack strap began to tear away at the shoulder, leaving
me with an ever more tenuous hold on the contents. As a "new year, new me"
project, I decided to fix the strap.

The first image shows a quick running stitch used to "tack weld" the strap back
into place. The second image shows the same joint from the other side with the
quick running stitch in place.

The repair is based on the
[iFixit Torn-Off Backpack Shoulder Strap Repair Guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Torn-Off+Backpack+Shoulder+Strap+Repair/40140).
The most important part of the tutorial was the introduction of the
[backstitch, video by Mary Corbet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_wVC84UmM).
In previous projects, I'd used a running stitch that worked ok for short
durations but tended to fall apart over time or as soon as any part of the
thread frayed.

One of the key deviations I chose from the tutorial was to use a webbing
material instead of a normal nylon cloth patch. The backpack already uses
webbing in the design and it seems to me that the webbing material will be
easier to sew than the patch (although this is more of a conjecture than a
fact).

# Setup

Initial stitches in yellow thread to align the webbing and backpack

# Planning

The stitching follows a figure eight pattern to allow for one continuous thread
to stitch the full repair on each side. (Technically, the problem is a variant
of the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg and isn't solvable but I cheat and use one
side from the existing stitching in the webbing to complete the look)

I use four smaller needles to hold the two pieces of fabric in a consistent
position and as reference points for the stitching.
