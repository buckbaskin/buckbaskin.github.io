One of the more complicated restorations that I'll need to complete is reviving
the older shorter chassis.

It was originally designed to fit the Evo body, but I'm hoping that with a
little massaging of the electronics and some custom parts for mounting the body,
it will also work to fit the classic Mustang body.

The wheelbase appears to be about the same it and looks like there is clearance
inside the body for the newer chassis design. The classic Mustang is meant to
fit on the original XMods chassis, which, among other things, mounted the
batteries on the side and placed the motor longitudinally in the center of the
chassis.
