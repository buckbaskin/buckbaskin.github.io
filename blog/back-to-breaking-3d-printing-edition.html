    <p>The second printed pedal finally broke (I didn't actually notice when it
happened). The two pieces still press fit together nicely, so it wasn't a
catastrophic failure by any measure.</p>

understand how it broke and how to make it stronger.</p>

<p>I've been doing some digging to see when I printed the pedals and found some
pictures I took of when I broke the other pedal. I did a
<a href="/blog/the-aftermath-of-breaking-a-pedal.html">little writeup</a> based on the
photos and what I remember; however, I still haven't found photos from the
original print. Even if I can't find the original print date, the post from
January 2021 would date the print to late 2020, which means that the pedal has
held up for at least two and a half years.</p>
