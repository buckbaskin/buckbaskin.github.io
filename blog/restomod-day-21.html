    <p>Today was mostly a breaking day. The printed half-shaft design melted itself
apart after some high voltage testing for a couple of minutes, so it's going to
need a redesign.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_5475.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Looking closer, it appears that just the outboard end where it meets the axle is
damaged; however, I'm going to update the design to be more uniformly bulkier.</p>

<p>After smelling some melting plastic while running the motor at 9V, it seemed
like more cooling flow was going to be required to run the car at higher
voltage. There seems to be plenty of area for flow in the front of the vehicle
with a little bumper redesign to open things up.</p>

<p>The roof doesn't seem very promising. It's a relatively small opening and as far
as I've seen it's only on the '05 Mustang.</p>

<p>The rear can be opened up significantly with a new design; however, the airflow
is also maximally restricted by the mounting for the plastic clip that holds the
body onto the chassis. Perhaps some more breaking is in order before it'll work
to build up the max-airflow car.</p>
