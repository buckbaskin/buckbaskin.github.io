    <p>I have a sweatshirt that ripped a pocket. It's quite comfy, but I don't wear it
much because I always worry about losing something in the pockets. Today I
decided to sew up the pocket. I also considered patching it but the whole was
small enough that it didn't need a patch.</p>
<p>The whole was about 1 and a half inches long. Fortunately, there was some
fabric material available on both sides of the tear and not just the zipper.</p>

<p>To fix it up, I decided to sew it like I was lacing up shoes</p>
<p><img alt="Black fabric with blue thread haphazardly tangled around a seam where the hole used to be" src="/blog/img/IMG_4043.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
