    <p>The suspension work continues! The rear design with short arms plastically
deformed after the first flex, so I ended up changing to a more complicated
design with longer arms. The new design should also allow for equal length and
thickness arms on the front and rear designs.</p>
<h1 id="front-design">Front Design<a class="headerlink" href="#front-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p><img alt="Front Flex Front Unloaded" src="/blog/img/IMG_5401.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>A closer look</p>

<h1 id="rear-design">Rear Design<a class="headerlink" href="#rear-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>Based on the front design, but with different packaging for the rear dimensions
of the chassis.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex 3/4" src="/blog/img/IMG_5384.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Top" src="/blog/img/IMG_5385.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Back" src="/blog/img/IMG_5386.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The rear suspension design has to deal with quite a lot of travel given the
length of the arms as designed.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Back Compressed Spacing" src="/blog/img/IMG_5387.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Each bushing is ~2mm, so it's between 3 and 4 mm of suspension travel</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Back Compressed Spacers" src="/blog/img/IMG_5388.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>A different view of the spacing</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Back Exposed Spacing" src="/blog/img/IMG_5389.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>A closer look at the right side</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Back Focused Spacing" src="/blog/img/IMG_5391.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>This leads to a huge amount of flex in the rear suspension, which led to plastic
deformation when I compressed it fully.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Full Compression" src="/blog/img/IMG_5398.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Even when unloaded the suspension is still deformed after one compression cycle</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Unloaded" src="/blog/img/IMG_5396.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>You can see the results of the deformation near the mounting screw</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Flex Post Compression Focused" src="/blog/img/IMG_5405.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Here you can see the stress deformations. Of note, the fractures tend to travel
along the printed fill lines and seem to originate from where the screw mounts
the suspension.</p>

<p>A closer look at the left side</p>

<h1 id="checking-to-see-how-it-looks">Checking to see how it looks<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-to-see-how-it-looks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>The new suspension has a high effective spring rate, so the body rides
relatively high.</p>
<p><img alt="Classic Mustang on chassis with new suspension" src="/blog/img/IMG_5406.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="new-rear-design">New Rear Design<a class="headerlink" href="#new-rear-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>The new design lengthens the arms to reduce how much the plastic needs to flex
for a given length. This "dog-bone" packaging does make the arms much weaker;
however, this approaches a similar spring rate as the original XMods suspension
design.</p>
<p><img alt="New dog-bone rear suspension 3/4" src="/blog/img/IMG_5411.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>When printed the gap is almost not there. It's just enough to be able to gently
snap apart after taking the part off the print bed.</p>
<p><img alt="Dog-bone rear suspension top" src="/blog/img/IMG_5412.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>With no load the suspension sits slightly flexed</p>
<p><img alt="Dog-bone rear suspension back" src="/blog/img/IMG_5413.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="stress-testing-the-new-rear-design">Stress-Testing the New Rear Design<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-testing-the-new-rear-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>Under compression. Note significantly reduced curvature compared with the
original rear design.</p>
<p><img alt="Dog-bone rear suspension fully compressed" src="/blog/img/IMG_5415.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Here's a closer look at the new design after it'd been forced through its range
of motion a couple of times. The fractures seem to spread from the end of the
split between the mount and the arms. There's a similar pattern here of the
stress travelling parallel to the fill direction.</p>

<p>Close up of the stress pattern in the new design</p>
<p><img alt="Dog-bone suspension with stress fractures macro" src="/blog/img/IMG_5423.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="slicing-up-the-new-design">Slicing Up the New Design<a class="headerlink" href="#slicing-up-the-new-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>Looking at the slicing for the new design, it's easier to see the fill direction
with the default settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Slicer view of stressed layer" src="/blog/img/Alpha3_FlexRearSus_Slice_Partial.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The stresses seem to concentrate along the red fill</p>
<p><img alt="Top down slicer view" src="/blog/img/Alpha3_FlexRearSus_Slice_Over.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>I was originally concerned that printing the version number into the part would
cause it to break more easily; however, the tension stresses are primarily on
the other side of the part. It appears that the design resists compressive
forces well enough that there isn't visible deformation on the top.</p>
<p><img alt="Slicer view of exposed top layer" src="/blog/img/Alpha3_FlexRearSus_Slice_Under.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>To adjust the design and see if I can get better stress patterns (and less
permanent deformation) I decided to try increasing the shells to align the fill
along the direction where it would be most stressed. In the XMods design, the
lower A-arms can handle a lot of the longitudinal and lateral loading from the 
road, so the upper A-arm should mostly be stressed vertically (in an ideal world
for this design). Even in a non-ideal world, the forces should primarily act to
bend the suspension instead of shearing it, so the aligned print shouldn't have
too much downside.</p>
