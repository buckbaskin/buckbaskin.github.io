         title="Permalink to Tearing Down a Quadcopter: Part 4 - Reading Upside Down">link</a></p>
    <p>I decided to go for the full-break method of investigating the electronics, and
while it worked out well to start, it's looking iffy going forward. After some
early success looking at the chips on top of the board in the
<a href="/blog/tearing-down-a-quadcopter-part-3-reading-a-circuit-board.html">last post</a>, I'm running into some more trouble
with the bottom of the board.</p>
<p><img alt="Bare quadcopter electronics" src="/blog/img/naked_quadcopter.jpg"></p>
<p>For one, the text on the integrated circuits is a little less clear with less
obvious branding. The easier to read of the two parts just has a part number,
and the other one has a blurry logo that's hard to pin down and text that is
relatively murky. I haven't been able to make much headway, but in the process
I did learn that the 3 pin 2312 is probably a MOSFET rated to about 20 volts.</p>
<p><img alt="The two chips in question" src="/blog/img/two_chips.jpg"></p>
<p>Of somewhat interesting note, the antenna from the other side of the board
appears to connect via a via to the <code>20_GG7R2S 1</code> board.</p>
<p>The rest of the 3 digit numbered parts appear to be resistors of various values.
The first two digits are multiplied by 10 to the power of the last digit. For
example, <code>100</code> corresponds to <code>10 * 10^0 = 10 Ohm</code> and <code>332</code> corresponds to
<code>33 * 10^2 = 3.3 kOhm</code>.</p>
<p>I also found a surface mount
<a href="http://www.sphere.bc.ca/download/smd-codebook.pdf">codebook</a>
for deciphering the codes that manufacturers put on their tiny chips. More
mildly interesting than useful in this case. It hasn't seemed to lead to
anything too exciting.</p>
<p>I think that the short and boring conclusion now is that the board consists of
an IMU and a microcontroller for reading it, and then the quadcopter is
"balanced" by combining the input from the IMU and the controller.</p>
