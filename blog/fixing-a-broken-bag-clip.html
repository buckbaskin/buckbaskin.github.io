    <h1 id="the-problem">The Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>Let me introduce you to my backpack, which I have lovingly used for many years:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0346.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The left half of the insertion side of the clip broke off (I may or may not have
stepped on it...)</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0345.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-solution" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>3D Printing to the rescue! I spent a lot of time with some calipers measuring
different aspects of the clip. It turns out the key dimensions are the height of
the inserted component and making sure it's not too long.</p>
<p>Getting to this point took 3 prints and lots of passes through the slicer. The
fine geometry in general and some adhesion issues meant that the printing wasn't
as reliable as simpler designs I've been printing recently.</p>
<p>Also, getting the
fit right to be able to slip the existing webbing into the clip without it
slipping out easily took a handful of tries to get right. Even after the first
clip that snapped into place nicely enough, the grip on the webbing was fairly
loose and would slide out. The bag would stay clipped, but not secured like with
the non-printed design. The latest iteration largely addresses that, although I
still see some room for improvement.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0350.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Overall, I'd say things come together pretty nicely.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0347.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Taking a closer look, there's also some room for improvement for some more
cosmetic areas: The curvature at the interface between the existing grey side
and the orange new print don't match that well. Also, in an attempt to make the
design more robust to measurements, there is some slop, leading to a "panel gap"</p>
