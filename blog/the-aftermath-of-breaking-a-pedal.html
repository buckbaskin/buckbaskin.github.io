    <p>The pedal for my bike broke without warning. Maybe there was a warning, but I
missed it. Anyway.</p>

<p>It's interesting to take a look at how it broke. There is a series of color
gradients, which makes me think that it cracked and broke progressively with
increasing exposure to the environment, followed by one big break when I tried
to accelerate.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, when the pedal broke the plastic piece that I'd printed also
broke. I think the mechanics are easier here. My weight landed on the pedal as
it fell to the ground and it looks like it broke at the impact point.</p>

<p>Externally, there are some steps in the cracked edge, which seems like some of
the fracture happened along layers. Internally, there isn't a clear fracture
along the infill which makes it seem like the layers fused together nicely with
the gyrodial infill.</p>

<p>For a dash of positivity, the other pedal is holding up nicely.</p>
