    <p>Today focused on simplifying the suspension with a printed design. There's
nothing fundamentally wrong with the existing XMods suspension, but I do think
there's room for improvement. For example, the existing suspension limits its
own range of motion and has relatively poor ground clearance. Also, I've taken
it upon myself to replace most of the front clip with printed parts now that
I've gone off the deep end and printed the uprights.</p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of Old and New Suspension" src="/blog/img/IMG_5362.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="front-suspension">Front Suspension<a class="headerlink" href="#front-suspension" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>One of the original designs for the front suspension worked fairly well;
however, it cracked near the mounting point and was slightly too loose.</p>
<p><img alt="Cracked Suspension Front View" src="/blog/img/IMG_5364.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Here the crack can be seen from the top of the suspension.</p>
<p><img alt="Cracked Suspension Top View" src="/blog/img/IMG_5363.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>To compensate for that failure, I went up to 1.5mm (15 layers) for the new
design, which appears to do the trick and resist plastic deformation. With the
new design printed inverted, it is also easier to control the resting ride
height (extra layers in the end-cups) and the suspension stiffness (layers
between the mounting screws and the wheels.</p>
<p><img alt="Final Resting Suspension" src="/blog/img/IMG_5372.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The final design can flex quite a bit; however, it's relatively stiff. Perhaps on
a smooth surface the suspension will work, but it's worth investigating softer
designs.</p>
<p><img alt="Final Compressed Suspension" src="/blog/img/IMG_5373.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>For softer
suspensions, I think there will be a balance between the suspension's softness
and its ability to resist shock loads or stress cycles. Perhaps some combination
of changing the cross section may help to provide similar stiffness with reduced
effective flexing. This would require increasing the cross section's area moment
of inertia, but likely increasing the effective length of the suspension arm.</p>

<p>The CAD for the front suspension:</p>

<h1 id="rear-suspension">Rear Suspension<a class="headerlink" href="#rear-suspension" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>The rear suspension has similar space as the front suspension; however, the rear
gearbox intrudes on the space, which could affect the rear suspension spring
rate. On the other hand, the screw mounts are further out, so there is a reduced
space from the mounting screws to the rear uprights. The reduced width might
balance out the decreased length to have the end spring rate be similar, or the
rear suspension might need an adjustment in the number of layers.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Setup" src="/blog/img/IMG_5377.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>In an unfortunate turn of events, the first print of the rear suspension was too
wide for the uprights.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear Suspension Flex is too wide" src="/blog/img/IMG_5381.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>With some adjustment, the rear suspension should be good to go and fit within
the packaging constraints.</p>
