<h2 id="small-center-gear">Small Center Gear<a class="headerlink" href="#small-center-gear" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here's a closeup of the center gear for the planet system. It is designed to
press-fit onto the motor driveshaft. It printed well (better than the planet
gears), but the printer was printing it slightly over size, so the gears weren't
meshing well or fitting in the outer gear. Given the scale, I'm going to need to
dial in the printer a bit further to get accurate sizing. In this case, even
being off by 0.1mm is enough to prevent the design from working.</p>

<h3 id="adjusting-i-meant-damaging">Adjusting? I Meant Damaging<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-i-meant-damaging" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the process of trying to fit the center gear onto the motor driveshaft, I got
a little too enthusiastic with a small file and ended up stretching out one side
of the gear. On one hand, it's unfortunate to damage the part, but it's also
very quick to print another.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0390.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Also, I'm starting to think I might be able to do
some hacky prints that are slightly too small and then use a mechanical process
to slightly stretch the print to its desired size. That would allow me to get
closer tolerances than I could get with the printer alone. I'm thinking
something analogous to casting and then machining a metal part. The trick will
be finding a milling process where I could get the accuracy needed to remove the
right amount of material and to make sure that I'm keeping the hole centered.</p>

<h2 id="internal-gears-are-hard">Internal Gears are Hard<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-gears-are-hard" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over many attempts, I've only had mild success printing internal gears. There's
been lots of stringing and the parts warp easily.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0391.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>To compensate, I've updated
the design for the outer gear of the planetary set to have an additional "brim"
within the design of the part both under the teeth and between the outer
mounting holes and the central circular area containing the gear. Increased
surface area should increase build plate adhesion, leading to a more stable
printed dimensions for the final product.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0396.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h1 id="new-design-built-in-raftbrim-for-easier-printing">New Design: Built in raft/brim for easier printing<a class="headerlink" href="#new-design-built-in-raftbrim-for-easier-printing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>To help the small gears print better, I updated the planetary gear design to
include a built in brim for the gears. This will serve a dual purpose: first, it
will provide a smooth outline and increased surface area for better print
adhesion and, second, it will provide a detent to ensure that the planetary gear
system will align axially.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0405.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Here's a closeup of the gear on a half-inch grid for scale</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0407.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>It's not quite a banana, but here's a non-printed gear from the original XMods
drivetrain for comparison. The teeth are smaller and more well defined on the
XMods part, but the overall size is comparable.</p>

<h2 id="battery-pack-loading">Battery Pack Loading<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-pack-loading" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to test out clearances for the batteries, I printed out a section cut
of the battery pack. It didn't print terribly well, but it still functioned well
as a test part.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0356.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>It's easiest to see here, the battery cutouts are non-circular at the top
to enable printing vertically. The top of the circle is flattened to a 45 degree
angle (from vertical) so that it still closely fits the battery but also would
prevent the need for support material.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0355.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0354.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The reason to design a new battery pack is to enable more flexibility in the
chassis design and to allow for two extra batteries (and theoretically up to 8).
This will provide a combination of better battery life and more power. Or maybe
just more power...</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0353.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h2 id="building-a-battery-cap">Building a Battery Cap<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-battery-cap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the features of the newer design is a battery container with ends that
screw on to compensate for variability in the battery dimension, the printed
part dimension and the size of the battery contacts.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0397.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>The first test was to ensure that the battery contacts were thin enough to slide
into the slot. Check off at least one aspect of the design that worked on the
first try!</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0398.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0399.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>After a little tappy-tap-tap, I was able to get the contact to fit snugly into
the battery cap. With a little adjustment, it should be pretty straightforward
to find the right combination of tolerances to have the battery contacts snap
into place with a little less damage.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0400.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>One unfortunate part of the design as it stands today is that it leads to the
print detaching partially from the print bed, which warped the (non-critical)
face of the part. Mark that as something to save for later when the design is
closer to ready.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0401.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<h2 id="but-the-screw-shoe-doesnt-fit">But the Screw (Shoe?) Doesn't Fit<a class="headerlink" href="#but-the-screw-shoe-doesnt-fit" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, one aspect I can't ignore is that the tolerances for the screw
itself were too small to let it slide through nicely. That's easy to fix with a
single change of variable for the next print, but a bit of a bummer that it
didn't work as expected here.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="/blog/img/IMG_0402.jpg" class="wideimage"/></p>
<p>Taking out the trusty calipers, we can see that I'm not off by a lot (somewhere
in the 0.1 to 0.2 mm range).</p>
